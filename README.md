# Code-Refactoring-for-Horiseon-s-Website

Search engine optimization link doesnâ€™t work

ALL div and no section

Little to no accessibility, no alt text

CSS disorganized, sections and their contents should be together

----

First steps:

Re-organized the CSS without editing anything so that everything is much easier to read / tweak. Every section for Search Engine Optimization was lined up together, every section for Online Reputation Management was lined up together, every section for Social Media Marketing was lined up together, all in the order the boxes are on the website. I used the same method for the Benefit Lead, Benefit Cost, and Benefit Brand sections. I left extra spaces between the sections I made in the CSS for even easier reading.

So far I have been able to reorganize the CSS without making any changes to the website.
